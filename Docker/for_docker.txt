                                         # no one allows to use poetry etc so we have to download python first and then by using python os we can use poetry

Docker_hub is the place where application are stored for docker mean   "docker run hello-world"    download the hello-world from docker_hub , where the hello-world was created by someone and stored there.


In docker we say "image" to "code" and running the code, we will say container


CMD>>> startup command to start app.



this command is used to excute the "commands written in file "Dockerfile.dev"    IN REPO (FOR_EXAMPLE) https://github.com/panaverse/learn-generative-ai/tree/main/05_microservices_all_in_one_platform/14_docker/02_containerization >>>> we have a file "Dockerfile.dev". In this file everything is a layer. When we run the file it started creating layers.
